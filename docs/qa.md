### Notes


### User Story Checklist

As a course content author...

* I should be able to use the rich text editor to insert a widget
  containing live-updating course information into any page.

* If I create a new page, or open an existing one, or edit the
  syllabus, an "i" icon on the rich text editor will appear.

* If I click this icon, a popop window will appear, giving me fields
  to choose from to display. By default, all fields are checked.

* I should be able to select any combination of fields and have them
  show up in the widget.

* Note that in the editor, the widget will just look like a big opaque
  placeholder. You have to view the page to see the widget content.


As a student...

* I should be able to see the course information widget in the pages
  where it has been inserted.

* Course information should be for the correct class, and show only
  the fields the instructor has chosen.

* Any urls in this widget should open up in a new tab.
